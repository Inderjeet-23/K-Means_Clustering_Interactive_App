# K-Means_Clustering_Interactive_App
This is for the Group Assignment-3 of Course ES654. We have an Interactive Application to Visualize K-Means Clustering.

Demo Link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Skratch99/K-Means_Visualization

----

In order to run the web app, you can simply run the Hugging Face application in the demo link given above.

If you want to run the app locally, you can follow the steps given below:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app using `streamlit run app.py`

----

The application allows you to visualize the K-Means Clustering algorithm on a 2D dataset. 
You can choose:

- The Number of Initial Datapoints
- The Number of Clusters
- The Number of New Points you want to add

using the buttons on the left.

You can add new data points using the "Add data points" button on top of the clustering diagram in order to see how the clusters dynamically change once we add a new data point.
